# Catalog Editor Guide

The Catalog Editor is a powerful feature that allows you to customize the IPTV content metadata from your Xtream Codes servers.

## Overview

The Catalog Editor provides a web interface to override and customize:
- Channel names and numbers
- Program descriptions and overviews
- Images and artwork
- Genres and tags
- Ratings and production years
- Content visibility (hide unwanted content)

## Features

### Metadata Overrides

All customizations are stored locally as "metadata overrides" that supersede the information from your Xtream Codes server. This means:
- Your edits persist even when the IPTV provider updates their catalog
- Changes are specific to your Jellyfin installation
- You can export and import your customizations

### Content Types Supported

   - Custom channel names
   - Custom channel numbers for EPG sorting
   - Channel logos/images
   - Hide unwanted channels

2. **VOD (Movies)**
   - Custom titles
   - Descriptions and plot summaries
   - Poster images
   - Genres and ratings

3. **Series (TV Shows)**

   - Cover art
   - Genre tags

## Technical Details

### Storage Location

Metadata overrides are stored in:
```
{jellyfin-data-path}/xtream-metadata/overrides.json
```

### Data Format

Overrides are stored as JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "ContentId": "xtream_live_MyServer_12345",
  "ContentType": 0,
  "Name": "Custom Channel Name",
  "Overview": "Custom description",
  "ImageUrl": "https://example.com/image.png",
  "ChannelNumber": "101",
  "Genres": ["Sports", "Live"],
  "ProductionYear": 2024,
  "Rating": 8.5,
  "IsHidden": false,
  "Tags": ["Favorites", "HD"],
  "ModifiedDate": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Content Types

- `0` = Live TV
- `1` = VOD (Movies)
- `2` = Series (TV Shows)

## Best Practices

1. **Backup Regularly**: Export your overrides periodically
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for channels
3. **Test Changes**: Verify changes in Jellyfin before doing bulk edits
4. **Document Custom Numbers**: Keep a record of your channel numbering scheme
5. **Use Tags**: Create meaningful tags for better organization

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Appearing

- Refresh the Jellyfin Live TV guide
- Restart the Jellyfin server
- Check that the content ID matches exactly

### Lost Customizations

- Check the `overrides.json` file exists
- Verify JSON file permissions
- Import from a backup if available

### Import Fails

- Ensure JSON file is properly formatted
- Check for special characters in file
- Verify file encoding is UTF-8

## Integration with Jellyfin

Metadata overrides integrate seamlessly with Jellyfin:
- Overrides apply during content refresh
- Hidden content is filtered out automatically
- Custom channel numbers affect EPG sorting
- Changes are reflected immediately in the UI

## Advanced Usage

1. Export overrides to JSON
2. Edit the JSON file with a text editor or script
3. Import the modified JSON file

### Sharing Configurations

Share your catalog customizations with others:
